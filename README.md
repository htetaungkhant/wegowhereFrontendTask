## To start the project, run
```sh
npm install
```

### For IOS
```sh
npx expo run:ios
```

### For Android
```sh
npx expo run:android
```

Recommended Nodejs Version is 20.13.1 or higher. 

I used "react navigation" instead of "expo router".

Since I don't have backend solution, I just stored the data of the cards into the redux store. So, I didn't persist the redux store into the local storage. The better way is to encrypt the data of the cards before storing into the redux store.
